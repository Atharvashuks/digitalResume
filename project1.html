        Developed a full stack MERN web-application. People can read other
        peoples blogs on the website. Users can login to their accounts and can
        create, update, delete their posts. Full security for the users posts is
        provided.
      </p>

      <p style="color: #bebaba">
        This website is developed using React JS as the main front-end
        framework, and Node JS is used for building backend structure and apis.
        MongoDB atlas is used as database. State management is done by the
        implementation of redux.

          Users need to log in for creating updating and liking posts. However
          users can read other posts on website without loging in.
